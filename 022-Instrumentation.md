## 01 - Sensors and Instruments

### Pressure sensing systems

| Type | Pressure Range | Applications |
|--|--|--|
| Aneroid capsules | Low | Altimeter |
| Bellows | Medium | Pneumatic systems |
| Bourdon Tube | High | Hydraulic systems |

### Thrust measurement

- EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio = Exhaust pressure / Intake Pressure)
- N1 (RPM of low-pressure shaft)

### RPM measurement

- Mechanical/Magnetic: Magnet rotating
- Electrical: Generator feeding synchronous motor, turning a drap cup
- Electronic/Magnetic: Pulse measurement with hall sensor

### Temperature measurement

- Bimetallic strip: Up to 400 °C
- Temperature-dependent resistor: Up to 500 °C
- Thermocouples: Up to 2000 °C

## 02 - Measurement of Air Data Parameters

### Airspeed

- IAS
- CAS = IAS corrected for Instrument & Position error
- EAS = CAS corrected for compressibility
- TAS = EAS corrected for density

- M = TAS / LSS
- LSS = 38,95 x sqrt(T in Kelvin)

### AoA sensors

- Vane Sensor: Free-flowing vane
- Null-seeking (slotted) probe: Two slots, seeking pressure equvalence

Both use piezoelectric sensing and are prone to position error

### Altitude sensors

- Sensitive Altimeter: Using two aneroid capsules, and mechanical link to display
- Servo altimeter: Electric sensing to aneroid capsules (requires power, but less lag)
