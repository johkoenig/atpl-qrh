## 021-01 - System Design, Loads, Stresses, Maintenance

### Design concepts

- safe life: One load path, no catastrophic failure for a given amount of time or cycles
- fail safe: Alternate load path, if one path fails, the other can take all load for a limited amount of time

### Signs of over-stress

 - Missing rivet heads
 - Wrinkles (wavy patterns) or strecthed skin, cracks, buckles
 - Screws are loose, damaged or destroyed
 - Physical restriction of control surfaces

### Possible limits

- Calendar time
- Operating hours
- Landings

### Corrosion

- Mostly a problem near the sea, when flying low and with hot temperatures
- Aluminium shows grey/white powder, steel shows red/brown
- Corrosive fluids: Mercury, battery acid, water, toilet waste

## 021-02 - Airframe

### Stability of the fuselage

- Longitudonal: By longerons and stringers
- Radial: By frames and bulkheads
- Around openings in the skin: Through doublers

### Cockpit windows

- Made of layers of glass and vinyl (with vinyl being more important)
- Heated to assure strength, impact resistance (bird strike) and flexibility of material
- Side windows are usually not heated, just defogged

## 021-03 - Hydraulics

### Basics

- System pressure in large aeropplanes ~ 3000 psi
- Nitrogen is used as inert gas
- Used by control surfaces (namely horizontal stabilizer) and undercarriage
- Failure of one of the two systems will cause a "Master Caution" (Amber)

### Hydraulic accumulator

- Stores a limited amount of hydraulic fluid under pressure
- Allows a limited amount of brakings, in case of normal system failure
- Further dampens fluctuations and allows thermal expansion of the pressurized fluid

### Hydraulic pumps

- Constant delivery pump: Constant amount, variable pressure
- Demand or Swashplate or axial piston pump: Variable amount, constant pressure
- Power-transfer unit (PTU): Basically 2 pumps connected, to transfer power from one hydraulic system to other

### Valves

- Check or Non-return valve: Only allowing flow in one direction
- Restrictor value: Allow flow in one direction, limiting in the other
- Automatic cut-out valve (ACOV): Returns fluid to reservior if pressure is above a predefined value

## 021-04 - Landing Gear, Wheels, Tyres, Brakes

### Nose wheel steering

- Via rudder: up to 7° (deactivated in the air by squat switch)
- Via tiller: up to 78°

### Tyre damages

- Sidewall damages (bulges, cuts) are not OK
- Limited cuts on the tread itself are acceptable

###  Brake materials and wear

- Metal: Need low temperature, therefore braking with large number of small pulses. Wear depends on usage time and temperature
- Carbon: Need high temperature, therefore use a single firm braking pulse. Wear depends on number of applications

### Autobrake / RTO

- Will try to breake at a constant rate (G-force)
- Any support (i.e. reverse thrust) will reduce the brake pressure
- Autobrake value must be selected proper to the surface friction
