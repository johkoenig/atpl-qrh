# 033 Flight Planning and Monitoring

## 01 - Flight Planning for VFR Flights

### Altimeter correction

From FL to true altitude
- Pressure correction: Reduce by 30 ft per 1 hPa below 1013 hPa
- Temperature correction: 4% for each 10 °C above ground (use pressure-corrected height!)

## 02 - Flight Planning for IFR Flights

## 03 - Fuel Planning – CAT.OP.MPA.106 and CAT.OP.MPA.150 plus AMC1, 2 and 3

### Basic fuel scheme

- Taxi fuel
- Trip fuel
- Contingency fuel (5% or 5 mins holding at 1500ft over destination)
- Alternate fuel
- Final reserve fuel (30 mins)
- Additional fuel (15 mins holding at 1500ft AGL)
  - For flights with alternate: In case of failure & hold over alternate
  - For flight without alternate: Holding over destination
- Extra (former: Discretionary) fuel (added by the commander)

### Point of safe return

- Time to PSR = t_total / ((GS_out / GS_return) +1 )
- Distance to PSR = t_total * GS_return * GS_out / (GS_return + GS_out)

### Point of equal time

- Distance to PET = (GS_return * distance) / (GS_out + GS_return)
- Time to PET = d_PET / GS_out


## 04 - Pre-Flight Preparation

## 05 - ICAO Flight Plan (ATS Flight Plan (FPL))

### Flight plan items

- Item 8 (Flight rules): V, I, Z (VFR->IFR) or Y (IFR-VFR)
- Item 9:
  - Wake: S to 7000 / H from 136000
- Item 15 (Cruising speed) is TAS
- Item 19 (Fuel endurance) is total fuel, without taxi

### Repetitive flight plans

- Minimum 10 trips in 10 days

## 06 - Flight Monitoring and In-flight Re-planning

### Hints for calculation

- Consider the direction, when working from both sides of a diagram
