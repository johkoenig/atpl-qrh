# 040 Human Performance & Limitations

## 040-01 Human factors in aviation

### 8 core competencies of a pilot acc. ICAO

- Application of procedures
- Communication
- Aircraft flight path management, automation
- Aircraft flight path management, manual control
- Leadership and teamwork
- Problem-solving and decision-making
- Situation awareness
- Workload management

### Categories of the TEM concept

- Threats (events that are not influenced by the flight crew)
  - Environmental Threats
  - Organizational Threats
- Errors (actions of the flight crew that lead to a deviation from the desired state)
  - Aircraft handing errors (e.g. flight controls, automation, systems)
  - Procedural errors (e.g. SOPs, checklists, callouts, briefings)
  - Communications errors (crew to external or pilot to pilot)

Both can lead to undesired aircraft states

### Components of a safety management system (SMS)

- Safety Policy (Setting responsibilities, accountabilities, processes)
- Safety Risk Management (Identification, Assesment and mitigration)
- Safety Assurance (Monitoring and Improvement)
- Safety Promotion (Training and Education)

### SHELL

- Software: Processes and Procedures
- Hardware: Controls of the aircraft
- Environment: Weather, ATC, ...
- Liveware: The other people around
- Liveware: The pilot itself

### Competency

- Skills
- Knowledge
- Attitude

### Types of countermeasures

- Planning countermeasures (SOPs, briefings)
- Execution countermeasures (acitve monitoring, cross-checking, correcting by the flying pilot)
- Review countermeasures (reviewing by the monitoring pilot)
- Systemic countermeasures (Systems like GPWS, SOPs)

### Culture types

- Non-punitive culture: No actions are sanctioned, not even violations. Unsafe

- Open culture: Transparency, Collaboration and inclusivitiy
- Closed culture: Secrecy, hirarchy, limited communication

Good safety culture:
- Just Culture: Genuine mistakes are not punished, violations are
- Reporting Culture: Mistakes are reported
- Informed Culture: Mistake reports are assessed
- Learning Culture: Action is taken on gathered data
- Flexible Culture: Must be flexible in implementing solutions
