# 040 Human Performance & Limitations

## 040-01 Human factors in aviation

### 8 core competencies of a pilot acc. ICAO

- Application of procedures
- Communication
- Aircraft flight path management, automation
- Aircraft flight path management, manual control
- Leadership and teamwork
- Problem-solving and decision-making
- Situation awareness
- Workload management

### Categories of the TEM concept

- Threats (events that are not influenced by the flight crew)
  - Environmental Threats
  - Organizational Threats
- Errors (actions of the flight crew that lead to a deviation from the desired state)
  - Aircraft handing errors (e.g. flight controls, automation, systems)
  - Procedural errors (e.g. SOPs, checklists, callouts, briefings)
  - Communications errors (crew to external or pilot to pilot)

Both can lead to undesired aircraft states

### Components of a safety management system (SMS)

- Safety Policy (Setting responsibilities, accountabilities, processes)
- Safety Risk Management (Identification, Assesment and mitigration)
- Safety Assurance (Monitoring and Improvement)
- Safety Promotion (Training and Education)

### SHELL

- Software: Processes and Procedures
- Hardware: Controls of the aircraft
- Environment: Weather, ATC, ...
- Liveware: The other people around
- Liveware: The pilot itself

### Competency

- Skills
- Knowledge
- Attitude

### Types of countermeasures

- Planning countermeasures (SOPs, briefings)
- Execution countermeasures (acitve monitoring, cross-checking, correcting by the flying pilot)
- Review countermeasures (reviewing by the monitoring pilot)
- Systemic countermeasures (Systems like GPWS, SOPs)

### Culture types

- Non-punitive culture: No actions are sanctioned, not even violations. Unsafe

- Open culture: Transparency, Collaboration and inclusivitiy
- Closed culture: Secrecy, hirarchy, limited communication

Good safety culture:
- Just Culture: Genuine mistakes are not punished, violations are
- Reporting Culture: Mistakes are reported
- Informed Culture: Mistake reports are assessed
- Learning Culture: Action is taken on gathered data
- Flexible Culture: Must be flexible in implementing solutions

### Axes of acceleration

| Symbol | Name | Description |
|:--:|:--:|--|
| +Gx | Linear acc. | Horizontally forward |
| +Gy | Transverse acc. | Horizontally to the side |
| +Gz | Radial acc. | Vertical |

Gz+ is the most intense as it moved the blood downwards in the body

### Hypoxia

Types:
- Hypoxic hypoxia: Lack of oxygen in the environment (i.e. by altitude)
- Anaemic hypoxia: Lack of haemoglobin in red blood cells to carry the oxygen (i.e. because carbon monoxide blocks the transporting capabilities)
- Histotoxic hypoxia: Lack of metabolism (oxygen exchange) at cell level
- Ischemic/stagnant Hypoxia: Lack of oxygen in the brain due to reduced blood flow from +Gz

Effects of hypoxia:
- Visual disturbances
- Lack of concentration
- Euphoria

Notes:
- 100% oxygen at 40.000 ft equals normal air at 10.000 ft
- Normal people are able to compensate up to approx. 10.000 - 12.000 ft
- Flying should be avoided 24h after scuba diving
- Effective performance time (EPT) is less than Time of Useful Conciousness (TUC)

(Rapid) decrompression sickness is causing nitrogen bubbles to be relased and following: 
- The bends: Causing pain in joints like arms, ellbows, ...
- The creeps: Causing a feel of ants under the skin (tickling)
- The chokes: Causing pain in the capillaries of the lungs
- The staggers: Causing a reduced blood supply in brain and nervous system

Important altitudes:
- 5 000 ft: night vision
- 7 000 ft: mistakes
- 8 000 ft: 100% O2 non-pressurised = MSL
- 10 000 ft: judgement
- 12 000 ft: short-term memory
- 20 000 ft: critical
- 32 000 ft: 100% O2 pressurised = MSL
- 35 000 ft: TUC: 45s
- 38 000 ft: 100% O2 pressurised = 8 000 ft
- 40 000 ft: 100% O2 pressurised = 10 000 ft, TUC: 12s

Thresholds:
- 7 000 ft: reaction threshold (start to make mistakes)
- 10-12 000 ft: disturbance threshold (capable of compensating)
- 22 000 ft: critical threshold

### Hyperventilation

- The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood decreases, as well as the acidity level of the blood
- More O<sub>2</sub> is in the blood, but due to wrong acid level, it cannot be transferred to the cells

### Hypertension

a.k.a. High blood pressure

Can lead to 
- heart attack (arteries come blocked)
- stroke (blood vessels in brain clog or even burst, resulting in lack of blood flow to brain)

Blood pressure values, measured in the arteries
- Systolic: 120 mmHg
- Diastolic: 80 mmHg

### Hypotension

Caused by:
- clinical shock (loosing too much fluid)
- Medication on low blood pressure

### Angina

Note: has nothing to do with what is commonly known as angina (i.e. throat pain)

- Narrowing of the coronary arteries, restricting oxygen delivery to heart
- can lead to sudden chest pain during high-demand phases, such as exercise 

### Circulatory system

- Pulmonary: Carries deoxygenated blood from heart to lungs (artery) and oxygenated back from lungs to heart (vein)
- Systemic: Oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all other parts (artery) of the body and de-oxygenated back (vein)

Arteries always move blood away from the heart, veins move it into the heart

### Respiration

The exchange process is called "metabolism"

- Internal: Exchange of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> between blood capillaries and cells
- External: Exchange of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> between blood capillaries and alveoli in the lungs

### Types of cosmic radiation

- Galactic radiation is steady and resonable predictable
- Solar activity (normal, random and solar storms) is causing cancer

- Both increase with altitude and latitude
- Effects on health start with 100 mSv

### Illusions

- Somatogravic: Acceleration of the body/head (acceleration feels like climb)
- Somatogyral: Turning of the body/head
- Atmospheric perception: Tendency to fly lower due to missing references due to haze or fog
- Empty field myopia: Automatic focussing of the eye to near distance
- Black hole effect: Sensing higher than actually flying over indistinguishable terrain (on approach)
- False horizon: Especially during T/O due to lights at night
  
### Motion sickness

- Dizziness, Headache, Nausea
- Sweating, Hyperventilation
- Vomiting

### Eyes

- Order: Corona, Iris, Pupil, Lens, Retina
- Cones and Rods:
  - Cones in the center, for color vision (photopic)
  - Rods around, for night vision (scotopic)
- Contact lenses are allowed for distant vision correction only
- Eye adujustment times
  - 10 seconds to bright
  - 30 mins to dark

### Hearing losses
 
- Conductive deafness (blocked ears, damage or eardrum or ossicles)
- Noise-induced hearing loss (damaging receptors in the cochlea)
- Presbycusis (by age)

### Vestibular Apparatus

- Semicircular canals (sensing rotational acc.)
- Otoliths (sensing linear acc.)

### Nervous systems

- Autonomous (ANS): Involuntarily controls the rogans
- Peripheral (PNS): connects the CNS to rest of body
- Central (CNS): processes and sends out motor commands

### Visual impairments

- Cataract: clouding of the lens
- Glaucoma: Pressure-rise in the eyeball
