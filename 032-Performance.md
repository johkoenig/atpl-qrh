# 032 Performance

## 01 - General

### Performance legislation

#### Performance definition

- Measured: On new aircraft
- Gross: Average performance in the fleet (= Measured, reduced by operating conditions)
- Net: Individual performance (= Gross, reduced by a safety margin)

#### Definition of take-off

- From brake-release to screen height (35ft/A; 50ft/B)
- Takes up to 50% headwind and more than 150% tailwind into account

#### Certified thrust ratings

- Maximum Take-off Thrust (TO/TOGA): The highest thrust available for take-off/go-around, time-limited (usually 5 minutes, 10 minutes in OEI situations).
- Go-Around Thrust (TOGA): Part of Maximum Take-off, same category.
- Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT): The highest thrust that can be used without time limit (e.g. after an engine failure during climb).

### General performance theory

#### Terms and Equations

- Range = Speed * Max. flight time
- Spec. (air) range: SAR or SR = Range / Fuel burnt [NM/kg or NM/l]
- Spec. ground range: SGR = Range over ground / Fuel burnt [NM/kg or NM/l]
- Specific fuel consumption:
  - Jet: SFC = Fuel mass flow / Thrust [kg/Ns]
  - Prop: SFC = Fuel mass flow / Power [kg/kWh]
- Climb Gradient: CG = change in height / air distance [%]
- Flight path gradient: FPG = change in height / ground distance [%]
- Flight path angle: FPA = arctan(FPG)

#### Movemnt of power and drag curves

| Flight phase | Power vs. TAS | Power req. vs. TAS | Drag vs. TAS |
|--|:--:|:--:|
| Climb | Down + Right | Up + Right | Right |
| Descent | Up + Left | Down + Left | Left |

- Mnemonic: Cl**i**mb = R**i**ght / D**e**scend = L**e**ft
- Left/Right shift comes due to TAS and does not exist for IAS (up to 0.4 M)

#### Aerodynamic efficient speeds

| Diagram | Point | Symbol | Meaning |
|--|--|--|--|
| Thrust and Drag over IAS | Max. excess | v_x | Best angle of climb |
| Power avail. and Power Req. over TAS | Lowest point | v_MP | Min. Power |
| Power avail. and Power Req. over TAS | Tangent from origin | v_MD | Min. Drag |
| Thrust over IAS (Jet) | Lowest point | v_MD = v_x | Max. endurance |
| Thrust over IAS (Jet) | Tangent from origin | 1.32 * v_MD = v_y | Max. range |
| Power over IAS (Prop) | Lowest point | v_MP | Max. endurance |
| Power over IAS (Prop) | Tangent from origin | v_MD | Max. range |

- Jet
  - Vx = Vmd = best ENDURANCE = max L/D
  -Vy = 1.32Vmd = best RANGE
- Prop
  - Vx = Vmp = best ENDURANCE
  - Vy = Vmd = best RANGE = Max L/D
