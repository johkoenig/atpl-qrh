## 06 - Aircraft Operations

### Abbreviations

- OCH: Obstacle clearance height
- OIS: Obstacle identification surface

### Procedure Design Gradient (PDG)

Usually 3.3%
- OIS with 2.5%
- 0.8% additional margin

### Types of SIDs

- Straight (< 15° angle): 20 km of track guidance
- Turning (> 15° angle): 10 km of track guidance (Straight to at least 120m/400ft)
- Omnidirectional: No track guidance

### Airplace Approach Categories

- A: less than 91 kts
- B: 91 kts - 121 kts
- C: 121 kts - 141 kts
- D: 141 kts - 166 kts
- E: 166 kts - 211 kts

### Minimum Descend and Obstacle Clearance

- MDA/MDH/DA/DH = OCA/OCH + margin
- Relevant elevation:
  - PA: Runway threshold
  - NPA: Aerodrome or runway treshold, if more than 2m/7ft below aerodrome
  - Circling: Aerodrome 

### Minimum Obstacle Clearance (MOC)

- Initial segment: 1000 ft
- Intermediate segment: 500 ft
- Final (no FAF): 300 ft
- Final (with FAF): 250 ft
- Initial missed app.: Not specified (very short, only from decision to start of climb)
- Intermediate missed app.: 100 ft (no turn) or 150 ft (turn > 15°)
- Final missed app.: 150 ft

### Accuracy of systems

| | ILS | VOR | NDB |
|--|--|--|--|
| Providing track | &plusmn; 2.4° | &plusmn; 5.2° | &plusmn; 6.9° |
| NOT providing track |  &plusmn; 1.4° | &plusmn; 4.5° | &plusmn; 6.2° |

### Fix Tolerance Factors

- Terminal Area Radar (TAR) within 20 NM: &plusm; 0.8 NM
- En-route surv. RADAR (RSR) witin 40 NM: &plusm; 1.7 NM
- DME Fix tolerance: &plusm; 0.25 NM + 1.25% distance to antenna

### Circling Approach

- Design based on runway, wind and weather (yes, really!).
- Descending below MDA: Threshold in sight, Visual reference can be maintained, obstacle clearance can be maintained
- MDH cannot be lower than OCH, and min OCH depends on aircraft category
- Loosing visual reference: Make a climbing turn towards the runway
- Prominent obstacles can be ignored if outside of final and missed approach areas

### Holding

- Standard: Right turns / Non-standard: Left turns
- For standard: Entry via Direct (-70 to +110), Parallel (+110 to &plusm;180) or Offset/Teardrop (&plusm;180 to -70)
- Outbound leg time: 1 min until 14.000ft, 1:30 min above
- If ATC defines time of departure from holding point, this must be met exactly (&plusm; 29 sec). Adjust holding if necessary
- Adjust heading and timing if necessary to stay within safe area
- Turns shall be 3°/s or 25° bank, whichever is lesser

### Types of Parallel Runway Operations

- Segregated: one for approaches, one for departures
- Semi-mixed: One for app or departure, one for both
- Mixes: Both for both
- Independent parallel approaches (Mode 1): Simultaneous approaches without specific radar seperation
- Dependent parallel approaches (Mode 2): Simultaneous approaches with prescribed specific radar seperation
- Independent Operations (Mode 3): Both only for departures

### Independent Parallel Approaches/Departures

- Runways are considered independent if centerlines are 760m/2500ft apart
- Departures: Flight path angle of at least 15°
- Approaches:
  - No transgression zone (NTZ) at least 610m/2000ft wide (from nearer RWY end to point where 1000ft seperation is established)
  - Monitored by radar

### Transponder unservicable

- Before departure: Inform ATC, note in flight plan. Flight to maintenance airport can be allowed
- During flight: ATC will try to make continuation of the flight possible

### Other

- SARPs (Standards and recommended practices) apply to all aeroplanes
- "Visual maneuvering (Circling)" is when the final part of an approach is made visually because the aircraft is not aligned with the runway (> 30°)
- Straight approach if 30° or less

## 07 - Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Air Traffic Management (ATM)

### Position report

- ID / Call sign
- Location / Position
- Time
- Flight level / Altitude
- Next position and time over
- Ensuing significant point

Memory phrase: **I**'d **l**ike **t**o **f**ly **n**ext **e**vening

### Time seperation on runway

- Departure: 2 mins
- Opposite: 3 mins
- Displaced threshold: 2 mins
- Intermedia: 3 mins
- Arrival: 2 mins (3 mins for light behind heavy)

Runways seperated less than 760 m do not count as seperated runways

Memory phrase: DODIA (alternating 2 and 3)

### Distance seperation on approach

- Default seperation: 5 NM
- 1 category: +1 NM
- X categories: +X NM (+X+1 if SUPER involved)

### Seperation over Navaid

- NDB: 15 nm / 30°

### Horizontal RADAR seperation

- Absolute minimum: 2,5 NM
- Minimum: 3 NM
- Minimum unless prescribed: 5 NM
- Between aircraft on same localizer: 3 NM

### How to Seperate

- Vertical seperation: Flight Level / Altitude
- Lateral seperation: Different routes / locations
- Longitudonal seperation: Time (or mach number technique)

Latter two form the horizontal seperation

### Minimum distance to be aligned on ILS/MLS

- Localizer: 1 NM
- Glide Path: 2 NM

Mnemonic: Invert the first letter

### Reference for OCA

- Precision approach: OCA = OCH + RWY threshold
- Non-Precision approach: OCA = OCH + Aerodrome elev. (RWY threshold if diff. > 7ft)
- Circling: Aerodrome elev.

### EAT times

New EAT times must be transmitted if: 

- Holding for 30 or more minutes
- Expected Delay for 10 or more minutes
- Revised time with 5 or more minutes change

### Longitudonal seperation for aircraft flying on same track

- Generally: 15 mins
- When position and speed is known: 10 mins
