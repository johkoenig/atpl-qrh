## 06 - Aircraft Operations

### Abbreviations

- DER: Departure end of runway
- MSA: Minimum Sector Altitude (provides 1000 ft clearance within 25 NM)
- OCH: Obstacle clearance height
- OIS: Obstacle identification surface

### Procedure Design Gradient (PDG)

Usually 3.3%
- OIS with 2.5%
- 0.8% additional margin

### Types of SIDs

- Straight (< 15° angle): 20 km of track guidance
- Turning (> 15° angle): 10 km of track guidance (Straight to at least 120m/400ft)
- Omnidirectional: No track guidance

### Airplace Approach Categories

- A: less than 91 kts
- B: 91 kts - 121 kts
- C: 121 kts - 141 kts
- D: 141 kts - 166 kts
- E: 166 kts - 211 kts

### Minimum Descend and Obstacle Clearance

- MDA/MDH/DA/DH = OCA/OCH + margin
- Relevant elevation:
  - PA: Runway threshold
  - NPA: Aerodrome or runway treshold, if more than 2m/7ft below aerodrome
  - Circling: Aerodrome 

### Minimum Obstacle Clearance (MOC)

- Initial segment: 1000 ft
- Intermediate segment: 500 ft
- Final (no FAF): 300 ft
- Final (with FAF): 250 ft
- Initial missed app.: Not specified (very short, only from decision to start of climb)
- Intermediate missed app.: 100 ft (no turn) or 150 ft (turn > 15°)
- Final missed app.: 150 ft

### Accuracy of systems

| | ILS | VOR | NDB |
|--|--|--|--|
| Providing track | &plusmn; 2.4° | &plusmn; 5.2° | &plusmn; 6.9° |
| NOT providing track |  &plusmn; 1.4° | &plusmn; 4.5° | &plusmn; 6.2° |

### Fix Tolerance Factors

- Terminal Area Radar (TAR) within 20 NM: &plusm; 0.8 NM
- En-route surv. RADAR (RSR) witin 40 NM: &plusm; 1.7 NM
- DME Fix tolerance: &plusm; 0.25 NM + 1.25% distance to antenna

### Circling Approach

- Design based on runway, wind and weather (yes, really!).
- Descending below MDA: Threshold in sight, Visual reference can be maintained, obstacle clearance can be maintained
- MDH cannot be lower than OCH, and min OCH depends on aircraft category
- Loosing visual reference: Make a climbing turn towards the runway
- Prominent obstacles can be ignored if outside of final and missed approach areas

### Other

- SARPs (Standards and recommended practices) apply to all aeroplanes
- "Visual maneuvering (Circling)" is when the final part of an approach is made visually because the aircraft is not aligned with the runway (> 30°)
- Straight approach if 30° or less
