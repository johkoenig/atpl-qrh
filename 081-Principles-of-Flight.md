# 081 Principles of Flight

## 01 - Subsonic Aerodynamics

### Definitions

- Mean geometric chord: Wing Area / Wing span
- Aspect ratio = wing span / mean geometric chord
- Taper ratio = Tip chord / root chord
- chord line = straight(!) line drawn from leading to trailing edge
- camber line = line from leading to trailing edge, equidistant from upper and lower surface
- Angle of attack (AoA) = angle of chord line and undisturbed airflow
- Angle of inclination (AoI) = angle between longitudonal axis and wing root chord
