# 081 Principles of Flight

## 01 - Subsonic Aerodynamics

### Definitions

- Mean geometric chord: Wing Area / Wing span
- Aspect ratio = wing span / mean geometric chord
- Taper ratio = Tip chord / root chord
- chord line = straight(!) line drawn from leading to trailing edge
- camber line = line from leading to trailing edge, equidistant from upper and lower surface
- sweep angle = angle of lateral axis and quarter-chord line
- Angle of attack (AoA) = angle of chord line and undisturbed airflow
- Angle of inclination (AoI) = angle between longitudonal axis and wing root chord
- Centre of pressure: Point where all lift forces act on (force vector, no moment). Moves forward with increasing AoA
- Aerodynamic centre: Fixed point about 25% from leading edge. If used as reference, then force & moment acts

### Pressure

Total pressure p_t:

- Static pressure p = F / A
- Dynamic pressure q = 0.5 * rho * v^2

According to Bernoulli, the total pressure is constant p_t = p + q = const.

### Two-dimensional airflow around an aerofoil

- In general, thicker wings have higher c_L and C_D for given AoA
- Stagnation Point travels to lower surface with increasing AoA
- Stagnation point is place where ice builds up first
- Transition point: Point where airflow switches from laminar to turbulent at upper wing surface (moves forward with increasing AoA)
- Seperation point: Boundary layer detaches from surface

### Boundary layer

- Area just above the wing surface, influenced by the fluids viscosity flowing over the wing
- Change from laminar to turbulent happens at the transition point
- Laminar: thin layer, smooth airflow, little friction drag
- Turbulent: thicker layer, unsteady airflow, more friction drag (but: less likely to seperate from wing)

### Coefficients

- Lift L = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * c_L * S
- Draf D = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * c_D * S

### Angle of Attack

- Induced angle of attack
  - Increases with decreased speed
  - Caused by upwash/downwash
  - Produces wingtip vortices
- Effective angle of attack
  - Increases with increased speed
  - Produces uplift

### Lift augmentation devices

| Device | c_L for given AoA | c_LMax | Max. AoA |
|--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Trailing edge flaps | ↑↑ | ↑↑ | ← |
| Leading edge flaps / slats | ↑ | ↑ | → |
| Spoilers | ↓ | ↓ | → | 

### Three-dimensional airflow around an aeroplane

- Wing-tip vortices are higher with high AoA = slow speed

### Total drag

- Induced drag (caused by lift generation)
  - c_DI = c_L^2 / (pi  * AR)
  - Increases at low speeds & high mass
  - Causes wingtip vortices
- Parasite drag (caused by aircraft moving through the air)
  - Increases at high speeds
  - Subtypes of parasite drag:
    - Pressure/Form drag: pressure diff. between leading and trailing part of aircraft, due to shape
    - Interference drag: caused by connection points of the surfaces
    - Skin friction drag: Caused by the air fluid in the boundary layer
- Tip tanks reduce induced drag but increase parasite drag

### Alteration of the TAS-drag-curve

- Increased Mass: Curve moves up and right (more induced drag, higher v_MD)
- Increased altitude: Curve moves left (higher TAS of v_MD)
- Dirty aircraft: Curve moves up (parasite & induced drag increase)

### Stable and unstable drag regions

- Least  v_MP (minimum power = minimum sink rate = longest time to ground)
- Lowest total drag at v_MD (minimum drag = minimum descend angle = max range)
- Below v_MD, total drag increases with reduced airspeed (unstable region)
- Above v_MD, total drag increases with increased airspeed (stable region)

### Ground effect

- c_L increaes
- c_D decreases (due to less induced drag)
- Downwash decreases
- AoA: Induced AoA decreases, effective AoA increases

### The relationship between lift coefficient and speed in steady, straight, and level flight

c_L ~ v^2

### CLMAX augmentation

- Leading edge flaps:
  - Krueger flaps
  - Variable camber flaps
  - Slats (increase in max AoA and c_D, but c_I will stay the same)
- Trailing edge flaps: (in increasing c_L/c_D ratio)
  - Split flaps
  - Plain flaps
  - Slotted flaps
  - Fowler flaps
- Spoilers / Speed brakes

### Means to reduce the CL–CD ratio

- Spoilers (slight reduce of c_L, high increase of c_D)
- Speed brakes (only increase of c_D)
- Flaps (but due to higher c_L, airplane can fly slower)

### Aerodynamic degradation

- Icing causes an increasing stall speed and reduction of c_LMAX and max. AoA

## 02 - High Speed Aerodynamics

### Relation between speeds

- ECITM on climb: left decreases, right increases
- ECITM on descend: right increases, left decreases

### Shock waves

Supercritical wing profiles have a weaker shock wave than conventional airfoils

- Bow wave in front of leading edge of wing
- Perpendicular or normal shock wave on upper wing surface

In general, before the shockwave airflow is supersonic, behind its subsonic

### Effects of a normal/perpendicular shockwave

- Air temperature increases
- Static pressure increases
- Air density increases
- LSS increases
- Total pressure decreases
- Speed of airflow decreases (to less than Mach 1 for normal shockwave, still above Mach 1 for oblique shockwave)

### Mach tuck / Tuck-under

CP moves backward -> Nose-down moment
