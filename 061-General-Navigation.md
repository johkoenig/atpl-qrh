# 061 General Navigation

## 01 - Basics of Navigation

### Earth shape

- Actually a geodid (irregular shape)
- Approximated as ellipsoid in WGS84
- In navigation further simplified to a sphere

### Coordinates on earth

- Longitude: angle between the plane of the prime meridian and line to a certain point
- Geocentric latitude: angle between the equator plane and the line from the centre of earth to a certain point
- Geodetic latitude: angle between equator plane and the normal (90°) to the meridian of a certain point

### Earth and sun

- Earth is farthest from the sun in July, closest in January
- Inclination of earths rotational axis is 23.44°
- Equinox (same length days) is about 21st September and 21st March

### Distances along lat/long

- N/S: 1° = 60 NM
- E/W: 1° = 60 NM x cos(lat)

### Directions

- TKE (Track error angle) is between planned track (C) and actual track (T)
- Drift is between heading (H) and actual track (T)
- WCA (Wind correction angle) is between planned track (C) and heading (H)

Pattern:

| TKE = | WCA + | Drift |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| C  | H | C |
| T |  T | H |

### Wind triangle on Aviat

Input:
- Heading on black number
- Airspeed on center dot
- Wind direction on red number
- Wind speed on triangle scale

Output:
- Course is Heading + drift
- Groundspeed is at wind speed point
