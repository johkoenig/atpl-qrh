## 01 Basic Principles

### Keying

| Type | Description | Used for |
|:--:|--|--|
N0N  | No Modulation, just carrier wave | Old NDB |
A1A | Morse code Modulation | Old NDB/BFO to ID |
A2A | Amplitude Modulated Morse code | New NDBs/ADF |
A3E | Amplitude Modulated Speech | VHF Voice and VORs |

### Modulations

- Amplitude Modulation: Carrier waves amplitude increases/decreases
- Frequency Modulation: Carrier waves frequency increases/decreases
- Phase Modulation: Carrier waves frequency is reversed

### Antennas

- Directional (Mnemomic: Pilots hate landing sideways)
  - Parabolic
  - Helical (sometimes)
  - Loop
  - Slotted Array
- Omnidirectional
  - Dipole
  - Monopole
  - Quadrupole
  - Sense Antenna
 
### Single/Double Sideband

In single sideband, half of the signal is cut off to reduce the necessary transmitting power. HF-COM uses SSB, VHF-COM uses DSB

### Layers of the ionosphere

| Layer | Height | Occurence | Effect |
|:--:|:--:|--|--|
| D | 50 - 90 km | Daytime | Absorbs HF and lower |
| E | 90 - 120 km | Day & night | Reflects HF and MF |
| F1 | 120 - 200 km | Daytime | Reflects higher HF freq |
| F2 | 200 - 400 km | Day & night | Reflects HF |

As a consequence, the frequencies propagate as follows:

| Freqency range | Daytime prop. | Nighttime prop. |
|:--:|--|--|
| VLF | Ground + Sky wave | Ground + Sky wave |
| LF | Ground | Ground + Sky wave |
| MF | Ground | Ground + Sky wave | 
| HF | Ground + Sky wave | Ground + Sky wave |
| Above | Space wave | Space Wave |
