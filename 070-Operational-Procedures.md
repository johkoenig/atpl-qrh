## 02 - Special Operational Procedures and Hazards (General Aspects)

### 02-01 Operations Manual

#### OM Parts

- A: General/Basic (not type-related)
- B: Aircraft operation (type-related)
- C: CAT, routes/NAV, aerodromes
- D: Training

#### Content of the OM

- MMEL (Master MEL) by manufacturer
- MEL by operators CAMO, not less restrictive than MMEL
- Jump seat usage if allowed by OM and Commander

### 02-02 Icing conditions

- 2-step process: De-Icing, then Anti-Icing
- HOT (Hold-over time) starts at beginning of Anti-Icing
- New contamination can build up before end of HOT, requiring a fresh treatment
- High wind & humidity reduce HOT
- Fluid types:
  - Type I: Weakest, used for de-icing, very limited HOT
  - Type II and IV: Stronger, used for anti-icing
  - Type III: Used for anti-icing on slower aircraft

### 02-03 Bird strike (hazard)

- Highest risk below 2500 ft
- Inform ATC when possible
- File report to authority after landing, if aircraft is damaged
- ICAO provides IBIS (ICAO Bird Strike Information System)
- Bird Migration Information in AIP ENR 5.6

### 02-04 Noise abatement

- NAPDs are established by the operator, based on the NADPs of the authority
- No noise abatement procedures below 800 ft AGL
- Disregard NADPs in case of
  - Emergency
  - Crosswind > 15 kts or tailwind > 5 kts
  - Ceiling < 500 ft
  - VIS < 1 NM
  - Contaminated runway
  
| Procedure | Scope | At T/O | At 800 ft | At 3000 ft |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| NADP 1 | Close-In | V2 + 10-20 kts | Reduce thrust | Accel., retract flaps |
| NADP 2 | Distant | V2 + 10-20 kts | Accel., retract flaps | No change |

### 02-05 Fire and smoke

- Brakes require cool-down after heavy use, otherwise fuse plugs may pop
  - Hot brakes should be apporached from the front/back
  - Use dry powder or water spray atomizer for removing oxygen from the flame
  - Cooling by water should be avoided, increases explosion risk
- Lithium-battery burning: Do not move, use halon hand fire extinguisher
- Crew should always use protective breathing equipment
- Fume in cabin, but no smoke -> Inform pilots
- Hand fire extinguishers
  - 1 on the flight crew deck
  - 1 for 30, 2 for 60, 3 for 200, then 1 per 100

### 02-06 Decompression

- TUC at 40.000 ft: 15-20 sec (slow) and 7-10 sec (rapid)
- Don the oxygen masks first!
- Rapid decompression signs: Mist, Expansion of body gases

### 02-07 Wind shear and microburst

- Entering microburst: Increase TAS, above G/S
- Exiting microburst: Decrease TAS, drop in ALT and V/S
- Microburst actions: Delay if known before T/O, Increase speed during approach
- Windshear indications:
  - Rain not hitting the ground
  - Wind sock changing
  - Lenticularis clouds
  - Smoke changing directions
- Downdraft (like center of microburst): Like less headwind, more tailwind, less AoA

### 02-08 Wake turbulence

- Wake turbulence occurs when aircraft is heavy, large, slow and clean configured
- Wake occurs from rotation to touchdown
- Wake gets destroyed by wind -> No wind, high risk
- Seperation:
  - 4 NM + 1 NM per cat diff
  - DODIA (2/3/2/3/2(3 for L behind M&H))

### 02-09 Security (unlawful events)

- ICAO Annex 17 is relevant here
- Removal of found items is not part of the procedure (usually done by law enforcement)
- Unidentified baggage: No tag, nobody claiming it
- Aircraft security Check needs to be performed if unaware of the status of an aircraft
- Regular training for crew:
  - Measures to avoid unlawful interference
- State of landing after unlawful interference must inform:
  - State of registry
  - State of operator
  - Each state of which citizens are on board
  - ICAO

### 02-10 Emergency and precautonary landing

- Smell of Smoke with unidentified source: Emergency landing
- Smell of Smoke, while search is going on: Precautonary landing
- Assure safe outside conditions for evacuation by: Parking brake, engine shutdown, evacuate
- Ditching:
  - Gear up, Nose up, Flaps down
  - Parallel to swell, unless strong wind, then into the wind

### 02-11 Fuel jettisoning

- Jettison system must be capable to drop enough fuel in 15 mins to comply with climb gradients
- Dump fuel above FL 60
- 

### 02-12 Transport of dangerous goods (DG)

- ICAO Technical Instructions provide info about packing and prohibited materials (among other information)
- Radioactive materials:
  - Must be stowed with distance to passengers
  - May be carried together with fissible materials
- Operator needs special approval to transport DG
- Materials reacting with each other may not be stowed next to each other
- Damaged/Leaking packages must be removed under operators responsibility
- Incident reports must be filed within 72 h
- Documents must be stored for 3 months

### 02-13 Contaminated runways

- Surface conditions (need to be > 25%)
  - Dry
  - Damp: Moisture, but no shiny appearance
  - Wet: Moisture appears reflective
  - Contaminated: Ice, Water/slush/snow > 3 mm, Compacted snow (all are falling from cloud)
- Max. speed for hydroplaning:
  - Rotating tyres: v > 9 * sqrt(tyre press in psi)
  - Non-rotating tyres: v > 7.7 * sqrt(tyre press in psi)
- Hydroplaning types:
  - Dynamic: On standing water
  - Viscous: On water + dirt or rubber
  - Reverted rubber: blocked tyre, heating up, forming steam bubble
- NOTAMs:
  - Estimated braking action (6-1) is given as "H)"
  - Validity is 8 hrs
