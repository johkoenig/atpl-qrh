## 01 - The Atmosphere

### 01-01 Composition, extent, vertical division

#### Troposphere

- Lowest layer, where weather forms
- Upper limit and temperature: 
  - Polar: 8 km (FL250 - FL300), -52 °C
  - Mid: 11 km, 56.5 °C
  - Equatorial: 16 km (FL500 - FL 600), -74 °C
  - Higher in tropical areas
  - Higher in summer (+3000 ft), lower in winter (-3000 ft)
  - Tropopause height ~ 16 * cos(Lat) x 

#### Tropopause

- Seperates Troposphere and Stratosphere
- Change in lapse rate of temperature (to zero, stays at -56.5 °C)
- Ozone heats up by UV radiation from sun
- Ozone is harmful to humans

#### Air

- 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Argon, Rest other
- Water vapour is the main reason for weather

### 01-02 Air temperature

#### Heating and cooling of air

- Solar radiation: short-wavelength UV radiation from sun (mostly heating earth)
- Earth radiation: Long-wave IR radiation, picked up the greenhouse gases
- Conduction: Air is warmed by ground during day, Air is cooled by ground during night
- Convection: Vertical movement of air
- Condensation: Forming of clouds releases heat

Most significant:

- Lower layers: Conduction and Turbulence (and some IR radiation)
- Medium layers: Convection and IR radiation from earth
- High layers: Absorption by the ozone layer

#### Inversion

- Radiation inversion: Ground cools via infrared
- Advection inversion: Warm air moves over cold ground
- Subsidience inversion: Air descending and warming up, staying on top of cold air (seen often in northern continents)
- Frontal inversion: Cold front moving, lifting warm air
- Valley inversion: Cold air moving down the hill

#### Influence of clouds

- Lowest temperature usually about 30 mins after sunrise on a clear calm day
- Clouds reflect UV radiation from sun
- Clouds absorb infrared radiation from earth and re-radiate parts back (lower & thicker = more)

#### Stability

- ELR: Environmental lapse rate (variable)
- DALR: Dry adiabatic lapse rate (3°C/1000ft)
- SALR: Saturated adiabatic lapse rate (1.8°/1000ft)

| Stability | Requirement |
|--|--|
| Absolute stability | ELR < SALR |
| Conditional instability | SALR < ELR < DALR |
| Absolute instability |  DALR < ELR |

- Stability is called neutral if ELR = SALR or ELR = DALR
- Inversion is ELR < 0, so very stable

### 01-03 - Atmospheric pressure

#### Pressure designations

- QNH: Atmospehric pressure adjusted to sea level
- QFE: Pressure on altimeter when set to 0 on ground
- QNE: 1013,25 hPa
- QFF: Mean sea level pressure incl. temeprature correction. Printed on surface pressure charts
  - QFF is higher than QNH if temperature is above ISA

#### Ridge and Trough

- Rigde: Line of high pressure (usually fair weather)
- Trough: Line of low pressure (often cloudy and precipitation)

### 01-04 - Air density

#### Density with altitude

- Sea level: 1,225 kg/m^3
- Half at FL 220
- Quarter at FL 400

### 01-05 - International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)

#### Temperature

- 15 °C on sea level
- 2°C/1000 ft until FL 360 (-56.5°C), then stable until FL 650 (~20 km)

#### Flight level pressure

- Sequence 7-5-3-2-1 for FL100/180/300/390/500 (almost 100 each)
- Half (500 hPa) at 5500 m / FL 180
- Quarter (250 hPa) at 11000 m / FL 360

#### 01-06 - Altimetry

#### Correction of altitude

- Use PIT rule
- 4% per 10°C ISA deviation (height only!)
- 27ft or 30ft per hPa on the QNH

### Rules of thumb

- In winter (cold), the mountains are higher (FL is less than true alt)
- From high to low, no-no! (Low system, FL is less than true alt)
