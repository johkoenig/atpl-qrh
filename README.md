# ATPL QRH

Quick Reference Handbook for the ATPL(A). These documents are intended to serve as a quick cheat sheet for the final learning phase of the ATPL(A) theory. It is not intended to cover the full syllabus but the topics that are most frequent in the questions.

The information has been added based on what I felt should be documented after going through the EASA 2020 syllabus. Feel free to add further information. However, please keep in mind that this should not replace any ATPL(A) training course and therefore it does not strive for completeness.
